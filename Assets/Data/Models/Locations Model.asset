  - Header: Village
    Description: The village lay nestled on the outskirts of the castle, shrouded
      in darkness and mystery. It is a place where danger lurks at every turn, where
      old and decrepit houses seemed to whisper secrets of a troubled past.

  - Header: Sewers
    Description: The sewer lay beneath the village, a putrid and fetid place overrun
      with all manner of filth and vermin. It was a place where the light of day
      never reached, where the shadows seemed to dance and twist in the flickering
      glow of a handful of torches.

  - Header: Dungeons
    Description: The dungeons of the castle were a place of torture and suffering,
      where the screams of the damned echoed through the cold stone walls. It was
      a place where the darkness seemed to seep into one's very soul, where the air
      was thick with the stench of fear and death.
